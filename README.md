### Identified Phishing Indicators
## 1. Suspicious URL 
http://www.firstgenericbank.com.account-updateinfo.com  
At first glance, it appears to belong to First Generic Bank. However, the actual domain is: account-updateinfo.com
The attacker placed the real bank name before the malicious domain to trick users. This is a common phishing technique called domain spoofing.

## 2. Urgency and Threatening Language
The email states that the account will be suspended within 48 hours if action is not taken. This creates fear and pressure.
This is a common social engineering tactic.

## 3. Generic Greeting
The email begins with “Dear First Generic Bank user” rather than the customer’s name.

## 4. Request for Sensitive Information
The email asks users to confirm or update their account information through a link.
Legitimate organizations do not request sensitive information through email links.

## 5. Social Engineering Techniques
The attacker uses:
- Brand impersonation
- Urgency
- Fear tactics
- Trust exploitation
